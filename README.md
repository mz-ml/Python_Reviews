## Semantic Analysis: User Reviews on Watches

#### Project Summary 

- In this project, I clustered reviews into different topics and identified topic keywords by performing NLP techniques (tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming), extracting Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency features, and building K-Means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

#### Outline

- Preprocessing Data
  - Stop-word removal
  - Tokenization and stemming
  - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- K-Means Clustering  
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
